        How to Play
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
        All you need to play the Up the River, Down the River card game is the standard 52-card Anglo-American deck, with no Jokers included.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom sx={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start', mt: 3 }}>
        Cards
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
        In the Up the River, Down the River card game, cards are ranked with Aces being the highest and 2s being the lowest.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom sx={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start', mt: 3 }}>
        Dealing
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      The dealer is determined at random, though deck splitting can be used if an unbiased choice is requested. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards based on the current round.
      You will choose the highest number of cards option, and the first dealer option when setting up your game. If your highest number of cards option is 5, you will start dealing with 1 card in the first round, 2 cards in the second round, etc. until you reach 5 cards in round 5. Then you will deal 4 cards in round 6, 3 cards in round 7, and so one until you finish after round 9.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      After the cards are dealt to each player, the remaining cards are set aside, and the top card is revealed to determine the trump suit for the round.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom sx={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start', mt: 3 }}>
        Bids
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      Beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, each player is required to make an estimate or prediction of how many tricks they can win before the round begins. Each player, in clockwise order, is required to make these predictions.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      The only limitations to each playerâ€™s predictions are that they cannot exceed the number of cards dealt to hand (though it makes no sense to overestimate).
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      Record the bids in the app by clicking the plus and minus icons.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      If you win your bid, you will receive the point corresponding to your bid, plus 10 points. If you do not win your bid, you will receive no points. 
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      At the end of each round, before pressing the next round button, use the checkboxes to mark whether or not each player won their bid. Checked meaning they did win, unchecked meaning they did not.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom sx={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start', mt: 3 }}>
        Trick Taking
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      After bidding, the trick-taking process begins. The player to the left of the dealer will lead the first trick, and turn order proceeds in clockwise order.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      Each player will play out a single card until all players have played one card each. Note that players must follow suit if they have a card of the leading suit.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      If no cards from the trump suit are played, the highest-ranked card that matches the leading suit will win the trick.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      If cards from the trump suit are played, the highest-ranked card from the trump suit wins the trick.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      The player who wins the current trick will take all the cards used in the trick and place them by their side. This player will lead the next trick.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      After all tricks are completed, the tricks taken by each player are counted, and compared with the bid made earlier. The players will tell the person using the app whether they won or not, and their boxes will be checked accordingly.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom sx={{ alignSelf: 'flex-start', mt: 3 }}>
        How to Win
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      After all the rounds are finished, the next round button will say "Finish Game" and the winner will be the person with the most points.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom sx={{ maxWidth: 310 }}>
      If the group agrees to finish early the Leaderboard section will display the current standings.
